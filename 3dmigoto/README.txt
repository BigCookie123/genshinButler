This is a release version of 3dmigoto GIMI configured for speed. 

Original program from https://github.com/bo3b/3Dmigoto.

I have modified the 3dmigoto .dll and .ini for compatability with genshin, and turned off most of the additional features of the 3dmigoto plugin in order to speed up its operation as much as possible. The green text will not appear when using this version, but Mods should still load properly. If having issues, try using the development version. 

I update the features of this program from time to time, so check back at https://github.com/SilentNightSound/GI-Model-Importer to see if there are any updates.

Place any mods created in the Mods folder and press F10 in game in order to load them.

If you have any questions or issues, please open an issue on the github page or send me a DM on discord (SilentNightSound#7430)
